# Education-Company-Data-ML

## Data:
Family Business Customer Data with columns including Customer, Sales Person, Location, Last Activity Date, Last Update Person, Date of Assigned Customer to Sales Person, Total Sales, Accounts Receivable, Customer Rating, Source of Customer (Online/In person), Specific Media Source(Wechat, Baidu, etc).


## Motivation:
We want to analyze what specific type of customer is most interested in the product the
company is selling. We also want to evaluate if the current customer ratings could accurately represent the customersâ€™ interest in the product. Moreover, we want to identify what source of marketing, type of communication and timing of checking-in are the most effective. We would also want to narrow down the important columns we would need to know about a customer to decrease the time needed to do background research and fill in the data (a.k.a which features are important to determine if the customer will be interested or buy the product).
